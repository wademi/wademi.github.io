### Quote of the Day:
_"I celebrated Thanksgiving in an old-fashioned way. I invited everyone in my neighborhood to my house, we had an enormous feast, and then I killed them and took their land."_<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Jon Stewart

### The Premise

It's clich√©, but I want to spend time thanking everyone who has had an impact on my life, whether they know it or not. I've decided to compile a few lists and quick descriptions of their affect on me rather than wax poetic with flowery language.

### Friends and Family
#### 1. Levi Tiberi

  My _"little"_ brother continues to be one of my biggest influences. I'm proud of him on a daily basis for all he has accomplished in his life so far. He motivates me to maintain personal passions and to take risks.

#### 2. Carol-Ann Tiberi

  My mom has sacrificed so much for my brother and I. She is easily one of the smartest people I have ever known. I have grown much due to the hard work and cleverness of this woman.

#### 3. Mitch Tiberi

  My father instilled in me the value of professionalism and hard work. I am amazed by how great of a problem solver he is. Bay Area startups have nothing on him but buzzwords.

#### 4. Brandon Belchar

  Brandon is like a brother to me. I've known him since he was 6 years old. 16 years later, he's still the dweeb I grew up with.

### Professional Relationships
#### 1. David Malan

  Save for my Mom, no one has had impacted my life quite as much as David. Quite literally, I would not be where I am in life without David. He convinced me to teach Computer Science and continues to be a moving target of a human being.
