### All the lonely people...

My heart is at it's most content sitting in a coffee shop. The quick, sharp buzz I receive from my café mocha focuses my ears and pupils to the work in front of me. The energy flowing around me keeps me moving when sitting still. Oh, and there's usually bricks. A certified hipster-level of bricks.

Eventually, when the espresso begins to wear off, I naturally become distracted and transition to the great American pastime: people watching.

Exhibit stage right, two rapidly aging late-20-somethings are clearly networking and attempting to pitch startup ideas to each other. All the while, you can here the two "young" men artfully intertwine their resumés into the conversation.

"Blah blah blah Software Engineering at MIT blah blah blah."

"Yeah? Blah blah blah countless hours spent at the Harvard Innovation Lab. Blah blah blah. Now I work at this software consulting agency. Blah blah blah few years at Google blah blah blah."

"Blah blah blah project manager at Facebook blah blah blah."

I wonder if they will ever take a break from circle jerking and actually create something meaningful...
