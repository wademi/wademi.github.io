### We regret to inform you...

No one worth a damn or remotely self-confident gives a (redacted) about where you went to college.
It's a dated, classist metric that us humans continue to use to separate ourselves, our favorite
pastime. Knowledge is knowledge, experience is experience, and intelligence is intelligence.
The college you attend does not innately showcase any of this. The sooner we realize this
as a society, the sooner we'll actually start valuing real intelligence.
