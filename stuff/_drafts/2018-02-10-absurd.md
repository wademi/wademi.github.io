### I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast...

As I and the entire student body watch this traditional Chinese lion dance, I'm imagining all of the student opinions on the performance. No doubt there will be rumblings later today about how ridiculous this traditional dance is. "Well, that was stupid!"

No, khakis are stupid. Not embracing cultural diversity in the hopes of preserving an antiquated world view is stupid. If you label others' cultures as absurd and clench steadfastly your pearls, you're missing out.

Spoiler alert: anything worth a damn is absurd.

Better to embrace absurdity than conformity. Opening your mind to the absurd breeds creativity. Conformity has the opposite effect.
