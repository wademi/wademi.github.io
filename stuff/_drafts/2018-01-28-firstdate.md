### If you're bored then you're boring...

I'm desperately trying to fit in interesting stories as to avoid you realizing I'm boring.
To be boring is to be dead to society.

What saves one from this fate? What makes one interesting? I refuse to think it's
something as shallow as prestige of career or net worth.

So what are we really looking for when we ask "What do you do?" A list?

I...
- play bass guitar
- snowboard
- teach Math and Computer Science

To list more, I need to be comfortable being uncomfortable and risk being weird...

- I grew up playing video games, exploring virtual worlds much like how you likely got lost
in books as a kid. While many were reading Harry Potter, I was playing the Legend of Zelda.
- My parents used to take my brother and I gold prospecting. We'd go camping, ride ATVs,
and hunt for gold.

I'm so focused on determining what I what I should share next that I'm failing to listen.
Don't take it personally. It's not that I'm bored, I'm just afraid of being boring.
