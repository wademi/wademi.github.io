### He thinks his educated airs, those family shares will protect him...

I work at a well-to-do, private all-boys school in Massachusetts. This school is a far cry from the cash-strapped Title I public schools in my hometown of Las Vegas. Every day, when I wake up in the school's teacher housing and walk to teach my first class of the day, I'm confronted with the stratification of our society. From how blas√© students are when discussing matters of familial wealth to the posh list of faculty alma maters, this is an ecosystem I knew existed but would never have thought to see up-close. Through a network of connections that only old money and whiteness can buy, these boys are set up to take whatever they want in life. Yet, they will enter the "real world" with their feet firmly placed in the past.

Their past is one that has given birth to Harvey Weinstein and finance bros. It is a culture that proclaims "boys will be boys" and actually believes khakis, coat, and tie are essential to success. Hyper-masculine behavior is built into the fabric of the school with mandatory student participation in competitive sports and hallway roughhousing casually laughed off. The culture ultimately cultivates "fine young men" but not necessarily good people.

In an effort to mitigate this, the school has begun to set aside time to discuss the issues of sexual assault, toxic masculinity, and race. These sessions unfortunately serve to be opportunities for many members of the school to pat themselves on the back for attempting a conversation. Little meaningful action or continued dialogue exists amongst both the students and faculty, but he latter is the root of the problem.

The perpetuation of the antiquated white, masculine culture begins with many of my co-workers. Their bodies and minds have become intertwined with the alumni wood carvings that line the hallways as relics of New England's past. For meaningful change to occur, the faculty needs to start looking to the future. Unfortunately, the most tenured minds form the walls that support this dated school.

Thus, the onus is on the new faculty, myself included, to stop this cycle from repeating without end. We have to find the courage to speak up for what is right for both our students and the world at large. We must not let ourselves become part of the problem.
