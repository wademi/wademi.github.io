### Quote of the Day:
_"There's a time and a place for everything."_ <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Professor Oak

### Motivation:
The time and place for musings is Saturdays at coffee shops. Today, the location of choice is Darwin's LTD. on Mass Ave in Central.

### TODO:
Today is going to be a day full of creative endeavors. Music composition, rethinking pedagogy, and a little work with react native. Somewhere in there, I need to grade quizzes for my day job!
