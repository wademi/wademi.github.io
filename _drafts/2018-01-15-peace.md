### And also with you...

Peace. Isn't that the goal of life? Nature. Is that the closest we can get?

The heart is never more at easy than in a body absorbing the nature surrounding.
There's no vista more gorgeous than a tree letting wind and sunlight pass though.
Simplicity means eliminating the human bullshit to achieve peace.

My soul lives in the rays of sun weave through the sun in the morning. My goal is
to feel the sun around the world, as there are parts of my soul that I have yet to feel.
