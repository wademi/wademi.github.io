### It's just called "Two Brothers"...

I have what the <a href="http://fma.wikia.com/wiki/Edward_Elric/History" target="_blank">Elric brothers</a> have.
Few people can wax poetic about the bond between their sibling and themselves as I can.
I'm spoiled to have been born into a life with such a loyal brother. As my brother and
I explore the world, whether by each other's side or not, we will always have an ally
in the quest. I look forward to the rest of our lives with us side by side.
