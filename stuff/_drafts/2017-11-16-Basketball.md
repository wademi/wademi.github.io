### Quote of the Day:
_"Basketball is my favorite sport <br>
I like the way they dribble up and down the court <br>
Just like I'm the king on the microphone <br>
So is Dr. J and Moses Malone"_<br>

### Basketball

There's no sport more egalitarian than Basketball. You don't need expensive specialty shoes (though an entire culture exist around shoes). You don't need any special gear. Rich or poor; it doesn't matter. All you need is a ball and find a court. Can you ball?

Best of all, you can hone your game alone. Grinding any chance you get.

But, it's a team sport. Eventually, you need to bring all your skills to the table and complement others. You need to be good at a little of everything.

It makes a well rounded human being.
