### In a fit of insomnia...

When I'm lying in bed late at night, unable to sleep, all I can think of is
wanting to be a child again; taking in novel stimuli with great wonder... Not yet
corrupted by the world surrounding... Truly happy.

Drinking allows us to take in pure stimuli again. Thus, we drink a
toxin to make us feel as if we're not dying. That's insanity. Death is not an event;
death is a process that begins when we give up our childhood. The rush to grow up
is suicide. Congratulations to you for being old enough to drink to forget you're aging.

Just give me my childhood back... But first, a nightcap.
