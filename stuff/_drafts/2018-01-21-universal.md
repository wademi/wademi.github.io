### Don't forget to bring a towel...

1. Everyone's going out this Friday night except you.
2. When a cashier says "enjoy your meal," your brain will automatically cause a reply of "you too."
3. All of your hobbies and interests are totally too weird and you should just embrace the zeitgeist.
4. That annoying, repetitive song plays 10x more often than any other song on the radio.
5. You'll definitely be the biggest disappointment at your high school reunion.
6. Wherever you live, your city has the worst drivers... Save for you, of course.
7. Yes, they're talking about you.
8. You could have learned the piano or a different language if you just started earlier. Oh, well.
9. Your voice sounds weirder than everyone else's when recorded.
10. It will definitely be too awkward if you share your thoughts now.
11. The right time is always tomorrow.
